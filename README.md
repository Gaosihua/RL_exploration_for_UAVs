# Reinforcement Learning approach for cooperative UAVs exploration of critical environments

This repository contains a collection of the files produced during the Master Thesis in Mechatronic Engineering we pursued in 2021 at Politecnico di Torino (Italy). Title of the thesis is "Reinforcement Learning approach for cooperative UAVs exploration of critical environments". Files collected here regard the simulation environment creation, the RL agents training and the simulation of the UAVs operations used to produce all the numeric results. 

A brief descritpion of the project, as well as an explaantion of each folder role and usage, can be found below. A more in-depth discussion of the project can be found in the paper we presented at the 2021 AIAA forum. In the paper, the main idea behind the project is explained, along with some technical detail about the development and implementation of the algorithm. The paper is available on ResearchGate at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353530217_RL-based_Path_Planning_for_Autonomous_Aerial_Vehicles_in_Unknown_Environments. 

## Project description



## Repository folders

Each of the folders in this repository corresponds to a different step in the development process of the exploration algorithm:
- models: the folder contains the data of the trained models. Currently, in the folder are uploaded only three models (two for the path planning agent and one for the coverage one), which are amongst the best ones obtained during the training phase;
- maps: 
- media:
- main:
- main [only coverage]:
- main [only path planning]:
- main [3D]:
- training coverage:
- training path planning:
