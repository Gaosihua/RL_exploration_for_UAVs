# master-thesis

A collection of the files produced during the Master Thesis in Mechatronic Engineering we pursued in 2021 at Politecnico di Torino (Italy). Title of the thesis was "Reinforcement Learning approach for cooperative UAVs exploration of critical environments". Files collected here regard the simulation environment creation, the RL agents training and the simulation of the UAVs operations used to produced all the numeric results. 

A more in-depth description of the project and of the files collected here can be found in the Documentation.pdf file in this repository.
