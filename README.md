# Reinforcement Learning approach for cooperative UAVs exploration of critical environments

This repository contains a collection of the files produced during the Master Thesis in Mechatronic Engineering we pursued in 2021 at Politecnico di Torino (Italy). Title of the thesis is "Reinforcement Learning approach for cooperative UAVs exploration of critical environments". Files collected here regard the simulation environment creation, the RL agents training and the simulation of the UAVs operations used to produce all the numeric results. 

A brief descritpion of the project, as well as an explaantion of each folder role and usage, can be found below. A more in-depth discussion of the project can be found in the paper we presented at the 2021 AIAA forum. In the paper, the main idea behind the project is explained, along with some technical detail about the development and implementation of the algorithm. The paper is available on ResearchGate at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353530217_RL-based_Path_Planning_for_Autonomous_Aerial_Vehicles_in_Unknown_Environments.
