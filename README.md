# Reinforcement Learning approach for cooperative UAVs exploration of critical environments

This repository contains a collection of the files produced during the Master Thesis in Mechatronic Engineering we pursued in 2021 at Politecnico di Torino (Italy). Title of the thesis was "Reinforcement Learning approach for cooperative UAVs exploration of critical environments". Files collected here regard the simulation environment creation, the RL agents training and the simulation of the UAVs operations used to produce all the numeric results.
